## CI/CD Pipelines 

Implemented a full CI + CD workflow using Github, Travis CI, and Amazon Web Services, created a pipeline that automatically deploys code every time you push the latest changes to Github!

## Multi-Container Deployments on AWS!

After building the deployment pipeline, the code will be tested for both Single Container and Multi-Container deployments on AWS.
